## Overview

Are you looking for a new way to look up programming concepts? If so, you could easily create an Amazon Alexa skill that’s equipped with the programming knowledge of your choice. This tutorial will teach you how to create one using a Twilio Autopilot Assistant and the Alexa channel. 

**Language**: Python 3

**APIs/Product(s)**: [Twilio Autopilot](https://www.twilio.com/autopilot), [Amazon Alexa](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit?&sc_category=Owned&sc_channel=WB&sc_campaign=TopNav&sc_publisher=website&sc_content=Content&sc_funnel=Discover&sc_country=US&sc_medium=Owned_WB_TopNav_website_Content_Discover_US_newdev&sc_segment=newdev)

Before we get started, you’ll need to understand the flow of the conversation between the Twilio Autopilot Assistant and the User. The User will start the Alexa skill and will be greeted by the Assistant. The User will then ask a question and in return will receive a response from the Assistant. 

Since we’ll be using my AI Bot Monty for this tutorial, the prompts presented in the project files are dedicated to the Python language.

**DISCLAIMER**: Twilio Autopilot is still in Beta phase. In the event that tutorial files are not working properly for you, please refer to the [Twilio Autopilot Python Quickstart](https://www.twilio.com/docs/autopilot/quickstart/python#create-and-train-your-assistants-default-task) documentation.

## Prerequisites

**Sign Up for Twilio and Get a Phone Number**

In order to work with Twilio’s products, you’ll need to sign up and purchase a voice enabled phone number. If you’re new to Twilio, you can start with a [free trial](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio). For further assistance on signing up and purchasing a phone number, visit [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

**Sign Up for Amazon Developer**

To link the Twilio Autopilot Assistant with Alexa, you’ll need an [Amazon Developer](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?clientContext=133-0245673-9043030&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.amazon.com%2F&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=mas_dev_portal&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&pageId=amzn_developer_portal&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&siteState=clientContext%3D133-4382177-5625724%2CsourceUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fdeveloper.amazon.com%252F%2Csignature%3Dwse0x4Ds0zS5zlRRqmd1e5Atgigj3D&language=en_US) account. 

**Setup Environment**

Before getting started, you’ll want to ensure that you’ve downloaded [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Twilio Python Helper Library](https://www.twilio.com/docs/libraries/python). Follow the download and installation instructions available on each website to ensure that you’re all set and ready to go!

**Download Project Files**

Download the files in this repository. In this tutorial, I will refer to each file based on how it is named in the Github repository. If you prefer to rename the project files, then I would suggest doing so only after the files are modified in the later steps.
